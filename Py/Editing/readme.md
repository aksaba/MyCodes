These are simple programs to search for specific words in a MS Word document and output the paragraphs containing the words. This is meant to automate the repetitive "Ctrl+F" searches usually done in an MS Word file.

An example of this function is found in "UKtoUScheck.py". This code looks for words spelled with British spelling. The list of words is listed in the program under the list "ukwordlist".

This list can be varied to search for any other words, as done in the other program in "find_text.py"

The source of the British and American spelled words is http://www.tysto.com/uk-us-spelling-list.html

Before running the program, a duplicate of the MS word file, in which the words are to be searched, should saved with the file name "test.docx" (which can be changed). The correct path of this file should also be provided.
